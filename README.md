# CSS Don't Repeat Yourself

Based on a programming principle DRY Don't Repeat yourself, I build a basic web-page with as less repetetive code as possible using SASS.

## WTF is this?

Inspired by Kevin Powell's video [Keeping it dry](https://youtu.be/0px6YH-cauQ) I decided to built a simple web-page that uses
as less repetitive CSS as possible using SASS. DRY or [Don't repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is 
a programming principle aiming to avoid and/or reduce repetition in code.

## What was used:
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS

## What I learned
* How to use SASS @foreach loops
* To keep an eye on how much CSS is written and how to reduce it.

## License

Pretty much use it however you like.
